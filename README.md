👋 Hi, I’m **James Jabal**, a licensed P.E.,  
With a love for tech and curiosity.

📺 From **x86 code** and demoscene flames,  
To **Bash** and **Perl** in research domains.

🧪 I’ve automated labs with **VBA**,  
Now learning new tools the modern way.

🐍 **First formal class**, and I’m here to grow,  
With Python, AI, and GPU flow.

🖥️ On **Windows 11**, I’m ready today,  
Can’t wait to code that GPU someday!
